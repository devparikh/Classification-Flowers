# Classification-Flowers
This is my first Machine Learning project as an exercise that uses a CNN to classify images of flowers into different classes. I built this project with Tensorflow and Keras in Python. The accuracy of this model is approximately 75% on the Validation Dataset, and about 96% on the Training Dataset. I am going to tune the model to make it have a higher Validation Accuracy.
