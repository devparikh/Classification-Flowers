# Classification-Flowers
This is my first Machine Learning project as an exercise that uses a CNN to classify images of flowers into different classes. I built this project with Tensorflow and Keras in Python. The accuracy of this model is approximately 78% on the Validation Dataset, and about 97% on the Training Dataset. I am going to tune the model to make it have a higher Validation Accuracy. 

# Next Steps:
- Try changing the architecture of the CNN to increase the Validation Accuracy of the model
- Use different pre-built models from Tensorflow Hub and use tranfer learning to make the accuracy significantly higher
